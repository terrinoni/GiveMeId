# GiveMeId
Extremely simple Java Spark server that gives you an ID.

## Usage
To obtain the final jar, compile and build the code with Maven (or by using an IDE such as NetBeans), then run the jar with the following command:
`java -jar GiveMeId-0.0.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar`

The Spark web server will run on port 8082.

Now, SHUT UP AND TAKE YOUR ID!!!1!
